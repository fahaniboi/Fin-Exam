# Final-Exam
 
Created a Unity Project before the exam to better prepare and imported all shaders that were used during the course. 

Imported a Wall Texture for the Even Scene.

The Wall Texture: https://www.istockphoto.com/photo/white-grunge-old-brick-wall-background-texture-for-home-design-gm625881290-110318577

Implemented the Wall texture to the DiffuseWrap shader that was previously made during lectures and then added the shader to the walls in the scene. The walls are created by using planes along with the floor also being a plane. 

Added a Specular shader and changes the colour to dark-ish green to make it look more like the scene.

Added a toon ramp shader to the Player. The player is created using a capsule. 
Changed the colour to a light green to make the capsule resemble the TNMT turtle.
